This repository contains a collection of Python programming projects covering various topics. Each project is designed to help you learn and practice different aspects of python programming.

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [0x00-python-hello_world](./0x00-python-hello_world) | Introduction to Python programming basics, including printing, variables, and PEP8 style guide. |
| [0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions](./0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions) | Projects related to Python control structures, conditionals, loops, and functions. Explore and practice various aspects of decision-making and iteration in Python. |
| [0x02-python-import_modules](./0x02-python-import_modules) | Projects focusing on Python's import and module system. Learn how to import functions, variables, and modules, and apply them in practical programming tasks. |
| [0x03-python-data_structures](./0x03-python-data_structures) | This project involves solving various tasks related to Python data structures, specifically lists and tuples. The goal is to practice and implement different functions that manipulate these data structures, such as creating and manipulating lists, using common list methods, creating and unpacking tuples, applying sequence concepts in Python, and using the del statement. |
| [0x04-python-more_data_structures](./0x04-python-more_data_structures) |  |
| [0x05-python-exceptions](./0x05-python-exceptions) |  |
| [0x06-python-classess](./0x06-python-classes) |  |
| [0x07-python-test_driven_development](./0x07-python-test_driven_development) |  |
| [0x08-python-more_classes](./0x08-python-more_classes) |  |
| [0x09-python-everything_is_object](./0x09-python-everything_is_object) |  |
| [0x0A-python-inheritance](./0x0A-python-inheritance) |  |
| [0x0B-python-input_output](./0x0B-python-input_output) |  |
| [0x0C-python-almost_a_circle](./0x0C-python-almost_a_circle) |  |
| [0x0D-SQL_introduction](./0x0D-SQL_introduction) | Focuses on the basics of SQL, including creating databases and tables, executing queries, and manipulating data. Covers tasks like listing databases, inserting records, updating values, and calculating averages. Designed to provide foundational SQL skills for further learning. |
| [0x0E-SQL_more_queries](./0x0E-SQL_more_queries) | Focuses on advanced SQL queries including user management, privilege handling, and data retrieval from multiple tables. Covers tasks like creating users, granting and revoking privileges, and using constraints. Involves operations on a TV shows database, such as counting shows by genre and filtering by ratings. |
| [0x0F-python-object_relational_mapping](./0x0F-python-object_relational_mapping) | Integrates Python with MySQL databases using the MySQLdb module and SQLAlchemy ORM. Focuses on object-relational mapping, allowing interaction with databases through Python objects instead of direct SQL queries. Tasks include creating and manipulating database entries, defining models, and managing relationships between entities. |
| [0x10-python-network_0](./0x10-python-network_0) | Covers basics of networking in web development, including URLs, HTTP methods, and using `curl` for HTTP requests. Tasks include writing Bash scripts for various HTTP operations and understanding web communication protocols. |
| [0x11-python-network_1](./0x11-python-network_1) | Focuses on using Python for making HTTP requests, fetching internet resources, and manipulating data from external services. It covers tasks like GET and POST requests, handling JSON responses, and managing HTTP errors. |
| [0x12-javascript-warm_up](./0x12-javascript-warm_up) | This repository contains a series of tasks designed to introduce you to JavaScript fundamentals. The tasks cover basic concepts such as constants, loops, conditionals, functions, and best practices, particularly avoiding the use of the `var` keyword. Each script aims to solidify understanding of JavaScript syntax and structure. |
| [0x13-javascript-objects_scopes_closures](./0x13-javascript-objects_scopes_closures) | This project covers various JavaScript concepts including objects, scopes, closures, and inheritance. It focuses on creating and manipulating objects, understanding the `this` keyword, handling undefined values, and recognizing variable types and scopes. The project also explores closures and prototypes. |
| [0x14-javascript-web_scraping](./0x14-javascript-web_scraping) | This project involves creating scripts for web scraping, handling file operations, and API interactions using JavaScript. It covers tasks from reading/writing files to making HTTP requests and interacting with APIs, focusing on practical applications and JSON data manipulation. |
| [0x15-javascript-web_jquery](./0x15-javascript-web_jquery) | This project involves front-end programming using JavaScript and jQuery, covering selecting and manipulating HTML elements, making GET and POST requests with jQuery Ajax, and handling events. |
